            <p>
                While on a road trip to her friendâ€™s place in Nevada, Amelia was caught in dire straits when her car bumped on to a roadside tree trunk.
                The vehicle leaned on one side and moved across the roadside woodland &#38; sled further in. Amelia got stuck between the steering wheel and her sit;
                she could barely move the lower half of her body. She did not find strong enough signals on her phone to dial out for help.
                There was Amelia, lost in the woods, alone, injured.
