                        <p><u>The journey begins</u></p>

                        <p style='text-align:justify'>While on a road trip to her in
                            friend’s place in Nevada, Amelia was caught in dire straits when her car bumped
                            on to a roadside tree trunk. The vehicle leaned on one side and moved across
                            the roadside woodland and sled further in. Amelia got stuck between the
                            steering wheel and her sit; she could barely move the lower half of her body.
                            She did not find strong enough signals on her phone to dial out for help. There
                            was Amelia, lost in the woods, alone, injured.</p>

                        <p style='text-align:justify'>The courageous girl did not give
                            up. She used <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> to send instant messages to her Circles and the responses
                            were not late to come. Within half an hour a rescue team from the nearby police
                            station was there in the spot and after a session of rescue effort for more
                            than an hour, Amelia was finally there, under the open sky, grabbing some fresh
                            air. What kept her on for the lonely periods? “I really cherished the warm tone
                            of assurance of my husband on the other side of our <span class="ring-color">ringID</span> voice Call” said
                            Amelia, “<span class="ring-color">ringID</span> kept going for me when the going got really tough!” </p>
