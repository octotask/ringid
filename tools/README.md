# Tools Directory

This directory contains utility scripts and tools used by the admin backend. To improve maintainability, scripts are grouped by feature or domain:

- `user_management/` — Tools for user creation, editing, and management.
- `analytics/` — Scripts for generating reports, statistics, and analytics.
- `import_export/` — Tools for importing/exporting data (CSV, XML, etc).
- Additional subdirectories can be created as needed for other feature areas.

**Recommendation:**
Move existing scripts into these subfolders based on their functionality. Add a README in each subfolder describing its contents.
